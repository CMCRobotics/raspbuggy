<p>The web-based programming environment supports :</p>
<ul>
<li>On-the-fly Python code generation (any change in the Blockly programming area is immediately reflected in Python)</li>
<li>A script preview panel (to see what the generated script looks like before execution)</li>
<li>Script execution monitoring (to know whether your script is still running)</li>
<li>Asynchronous console output (so that your program can provide debug outputs during execution)</li>
<li>and a very pleasant Bootstrap 3 based web user interface, as you can judge from the included screenshots.</li>
</ul>
<p>The generated script will currently only work for the Drivar Lego Mindstorms NXT layer, but it will be
very easily adapted to work with the Pimoroni Explorer HAT, or even a custom adapter board if we happen to come up with one.</p>

It is designed to adapt to a
large array of hardware layers, so that it can evolve through time.</p>
<p>In order to cope with different hardware platforms, it relies on a hardware abstraction layer called "Drivar".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Drivar is (currently) a Python library that provides a simple and stable API to give access to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling the activity of the car motors (direction of the rotation, speed).</li>
<li>Obtaining reading from sensors (proximity ultrasonic sensors for instance).</li>
<li>Acquiring and processing images and videos for image recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I have started writing the "Drivar NXT" classes, that allow the Raspbuggy to run on top of Lego Mindstorm NXT kit.</p>
<p>NXT kits are quite easy to drive from Python via USB thanks to the excellent NXT-Python library.</p>
<p>In order to organise our next Robotics challenge and introduce the Raspbuggy platform at CERN, we will use four NXT kits
that will provide an ideal development target for our contestants.</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>
