<strong>invaluable support from the IdeaSquare team and the CERN Micro Club</strong>.</p>
<p>What do you get when you gather fifteen enthusiastic engineers and physicists and give them a very fun Robotics challenge to complete ?

<p>The three teams (15 participants in total) were handed :</p>
<ul>
<li>a LegoMindstorm NXT robot (complete with proximity sensor, reflectivity sensor and a motorised non-permanent marker)</li>
<li>a Raspberry Pi pre-loaded with the Raspbuggy environment</li>
<li>and a USB battery pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their task ? Reproduce a given black and white 8 x 8 pattern on a piece of paper, then successfully exit a maze in the shortest amount of time possible.
Under ten minutes, and with only two attempts at their disposal to score the highest.</p>
<p>How did they fare ? Hum, as you can tell from the following videos, with mixed results, with certain very interesting strategies (we're grateful we used <strong>non-permanent</strong> markers, because that floor got stabbed quite a few times).</p>

<p>The Raspbuggy platform fulfilled its duties quite well, without any bugs reported and only one incident involving a NXT Mindstorm block entering a furious loop during one of the test trials (cause still undetermined, but most likely the Raspberry Pi's USB power bank running out of juice, leaving the Mindstorm NXT block hanging).</p>
<p>From here on, we need to consolidate the hardware platform <strong>sans Lego Mindstorms</strong> and organise... well.. another competition at CERN !</p>
