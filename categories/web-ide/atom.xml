<!--more-->
<p>A quick session at the CERN Robotics club to test the full environment and
demonstrate what we have so far revealed a few minor bugs in the Javascript,
the fact that the NXT Light sensor API does not seem to work as expected (to
be investigated), and the need to have an ABORT SCRIPT feature for all
those infinite loops and errors in waiting times....</p>
<p>But overall, we are ready for the 17th June programming challenge at CERN Ideasquare !</p>

<p>The web-based programming environment supports :</p>
<ul>
<li>On-the-fly Python code generation (any change in the Blockly programming area is immediately reflected in Python)</li>
<li>A script preview panel (to see what the generated script looks like before execution)</li>
<li>Script execution monitoring (to know whether your script is still running)</li>
<li>Asynchronous console output (so that your program can provide debug outputs during execution)</li>
<li>and a very pleasant Bootstrap 3 based web user interface, as you can judge from the included screenshots.</li>
</ul>
<p>The generated script will currently only work for the Drivar Lego Mindstorms NXT layer, but it will be
very easily adapted to work with the Pimoroni Explorer HAT, or even a custom adapter board if we happen to come up with one.</p>
