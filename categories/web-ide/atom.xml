<p>The web-based programming environment supports :</p>
<ul>
<li>On-the-fly Python code generation (any change in the Blockly programming area is immediately reflected in Python)</li>
<li>A script preview panel (to see what the generated script looks like before execution)</li>
<li>Script execution monitoring (to know whether your script is still running)</li>
<li>Asynchronous console output (so that your program can provide debug outputs during execution)</li>
<li>and a very pleasant Bootstrap 3 based web user interface, as you can judge from the included screenshots.</li>
</ul>
<p>The generated script will currently only work for the Drivar Lego Mindstorms NXT layer, but it will be
very easily adapted to work with the Pimoroni Explorer HAT, or even a custom adapter board if we happen to come up with one.</p>
