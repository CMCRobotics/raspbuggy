Successful integration tests... but we do not an ABORT SCRIPT button !

<!--more-->

A quick session at the CERN Robotics club to test the full environment and 
demonstrate what we have so far revealed a few minor bugs in the Javascript, 
the fact that the NXT Light sensor API does not seem to work as expected (to 
be investigated), and the need to have an ABORT SCRIPT feature for all
those infinite loops and errors in waiting times....

But overall, we are ready for the 17th June programming challenge at CERN Ideasquare !
