drive outputs, power the whole thing in a standard 5 volts, you would think to controlling a 4WD model car chassis is a no-brainer.
Well, I must be missing something.</p>

<p>Here's what we have so far :</p>
<ul>
<li>A 4 wheel drive car chassis, with 4 DC motors that require around 250 mA each.</li>
<li>A Raspberry Pi B+, requiring a stable 5V 700 mA.</li>
<li>A dual-USB output battery packing 6600 mAh and a dual 2 A / 1 A power outlet.</li>
</ul>
<p>... But no convenient way to connect it all.</p>
<p>The Pimoroni Pibrella, although adequately powered independently and able to drive the four motors, can only do so in a single direction (no H-Bridge).
The Pimoroni Explorer Pro (picture above) can certainly power four motors, but only going in the same direction - trying to reverse direction on one set of wheels (essential to change direction with precision) will not work.
We could certainly go ahead with a simpler chassis and only two motors (using a freely moving wheel at the front), which is what the Explorer Pro HAT is really designed for.
But we would lose a lot of precision in the movement, as well as the capacity to evolve on difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Ideally, a simple board that would exhibit :</p>
<ul>
<li>Two H-Bridge outputs, powered separately from the Raspberry Pi and capable of driving 2 motors each (2 x 250 mA).</li>
<li>A ground, 3.3V and 5V individually powered slots.</li>
<li>Two digital 5V outputs.</li>
<li>Two digital protected 5V inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>... would be enough to drive the four motors, collect input from two ultrasonic sensors and power a small LED array or an LCD screen.</p>
<p>Any takers ?</p>

It is designed to adapt to a
large array of hardware layers, so that it can evolve through time.</p>
<p>In order to cope with different hardware platforms, it relies on a hardware abstraction layer called "Drivar".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Drivar is (currently) a Python library that provides a simple and stable API to give access to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling the activity of the car motors (direction of the rotation, speed).</li>
<li>Obtaining reading from sensors (proximity ultrasonic sensors for instance).</li>
<li>Acquiring and processing images and videos for image recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I have started writing the "Drivar NXT" classes, that allow the Raspbuggy to run on top of Lego Mindstorm NXT kit.</p>
<p>NXT kits are quite easy to drive from Python via USB thanks to the excellent NXT-Python library.</p>
<p>In order to organise our next Robotics challenge and introduce the Raspbuggy platform at CERN, we will use four NXT kits
that will provide an ideal development target for our contestants.</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>

<p>...  But still in the pipeline are  :</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date Google Blockly powered webide</li>
<li>A complete Raspbian SD card image link</li>
<li>A Mindstorm NXT compatible abstraction layer</li>
<li>Disqus comments support</li>
<li>Facebook integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned !</p>
